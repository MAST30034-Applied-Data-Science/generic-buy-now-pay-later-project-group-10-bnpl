# Buy Now, Pay Later Project

### Project Description
A generic Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) firm has begun offering a new “Pay in 5 Installments” feature. Merchants (also known as retailers) are looking to boost their customer base by forming a partnership with this firm and in return, the BNPL firm gets a small percentage of revenue (take rate) to cover operating costs. However, the BNPL firm can only onboard at most 100 number of merchants every year due to limited resources. This industry project aims to generate a robust ranking system with insights to assist this BNPL firm in finding which merchants
they should accept.

The following questions are investigated:
1. What are the 100 best merchants according to your ranking system?
2. What features or heuristics did you discover that greatly separated merchants that should and shouldn’t be accepted?
